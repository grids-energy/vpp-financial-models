[x] Take the spot exposed savings from Amber’s front page as the base case of savings
[] Add savings from an increased response during super peak prices (<$1,000/kWh) with a model that allows the battery to capture the lessor of 50% or 60 minutes of super peak prices per day (sometimes the battery won’t be full or high prices occur during tail ends of trading periods)
[] Add savings from intraday arbitrage during very cloudy days (i.e. the battery will import from the grid during cheap prices to offset higher prices)
[] Add revenue from FCAS bids, taking into account reduced ability to provide FCAS when solar is generating and overnight when some batteries will be empty
[] Estimate % of bill as network charges then estimate a % reduction in those charges due to shifting load outside of times where the network is congested
[] Add monthly fee paid by networks for site level data (likely very small amount per month)
[] This gives the spot exposed savings vs DMO. For day ahead prices discount 1, 2, 3, and 5 savings some amount to account for the reduced risk premium customers would earn due to more certainty in pricing
[] Do this for each mainland NEM region
